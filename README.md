# Note Taker

## Description

This application is able to save, recall, and display notes for the user. I made it to help others keep track of their busy lives and avoid missing appointments, forgetting errands, etc.

## Installation

Clone the repo, open the folder in the integrated terminal or in your computer terminal, run 'npm install', and then run 'node server', cmd+click the link in the terminal.

## Usage

Click get started. In the middle of the screen, you wil see the appropriate boxes to enter the title and body text of a new note. Once finished typing, click the save logo in the top right of the screen. This will save the note and it will appear in a list on the left. You can type another note or click the existing note on the left to see it again. Once you are viewing a note, simply click the plus sign in the top right of the screen to close the note and create a new note.
